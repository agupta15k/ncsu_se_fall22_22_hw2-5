|Number of commits| 3 | There are a good number of commits in this repo https://github.com/gargpriyam21/CSC510_G46_lua2py/commits/main |
|Number of commits: by different people| 2 | The number of commits along with the changes made appear mostly balanced, except for one people https://github.com/gargpriyam21/CSC510_G46_lua2py/graphs/contributors |

|DOI badge: exists| 3 | DOI badge exists https://zenodo.org/record/7095269#.Yzunf3bMJPY |
|Docs: docs generated, format not ugly | 2 | Some amount of documentation present in the Readme |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 3 | 'what' documentation present |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 2 | Readme contains a few points on how to get started with the tool. No description of how to run specific tests |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 0 | 'why' documentation not present |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 0 | No short videos present in the repo |

|Use of code coverage | 3 | Code badge or report present |
|Other automated analysis tools| 3 | Github actions used |
|Test cases exist (dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base)| 3 | All test cases covered |
|Test cases are routinely executed (E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something) | 3 | Github actions used |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3 | Descriptive contributing standards file present https://github.com/gargpriyam21/CSC510_G46_lua2py/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md |
|Issues are discussed before they are closed (even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here) | 0 | No issues and no discussions |
|Chat channel: exists (Link or screenshots)| 0 | No chat channel evidence |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.(If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it) | 0 | No issues present for test case failures |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 3 | Everybody contributed to development |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 | Everybody contributed to development |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3 | Everybody contributed to development |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 2 | Some team members only contributed on a few different files in the code base https://github.com/gargpriyam21/CSC510_G46_lua2py/graphs/contributors|
|Short release cycles (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work| 3 | There are regular commits on the repository https://github.com/gargpriyam21/CSC510_G46_lua2py/graphs/contributors|
