|-----|------|---------|
| Video1 | 0 | N/A, no video showing new functionality. | 
| Video2 | 0 | N/A, no video showing new functionality. | 
| Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot) | 2 | Majority of the group members have contributed to the project. One person has made very few changes to the code. https://github.com/akshat22/SE_HW2345/graphs/contributors |
|Number of commits| 3 | There are a lot of commits in this repo. https://github.com/akshat22/SE_HW2345/graphs/commit-activity |
|Number of commits: by different people| 2 | The number of commits along with the changes made seems to be balanced, except for one person. https://github.com/akshat22/SE_HW2345/graphs/contributors |
|Issues reports: there are **many**| 0 | No issues present. https://github.com/akshat22/SE_HW2345/issues |
|Issues are being closed| 0 | No issues closed. https://github.com/akshat22/SE_HW2345/issues |
|DOI badge: exists| 0 | DOI badge does not exist |
|Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | 1 | Some amount of documentation present in the Readme |
|Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) | 0 | 'what' documentation not present. |
|Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z| 2 | Readme contains a few points on how to get started with the tool. |
|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing| 3 | Starting of the Readme explains why we need to use the tool. |
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 0 | No short videos present in the repo. |
|Use of version control tools| 3 | Git is used in this project. |
|Use of style checkers | 0 | No style checkers present. |
|Use of code formatters. | 0 | No code formatters present. |
|Use of syntax checkers. | 0 | No syntax checkers present. |
|Use of code coverage | 0 | No code coverage present |
|Other automated analysis tools| 0 | Not present. |
|Test cases exist (dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base)| 2 | Few test cases are missing.|
|Test cases are routinely executed (E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something) | 0 | No github actions present. |
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up| 3 | https://github.com/akshat22/SE_HW2345/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md|
|Issues are discussed before they are closed (even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here) | 0 | No issues are present. |
|Chat channel: exists (Link or screenshots)| 0 | No chat channel evidence. |
|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.(If a test case fails, open an issue and fix it) | 0 | No issues present in the project. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files| 0 | No issues present in the project.|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)| 3 | Whole team contributed on the same software stack. |
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)| 3 | Whole team contributed on the same software stack. |
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base| 2 | 	Some team members only contributed on a few different files in the code base https://github.com/akshat22/SE_HW2345/graphs/contributors|
|Short release cycles (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work| 3 | The commits are done in increments. https://github.com/akshat22/SE_HW2345/graphs/contributors|
